# Introduction to devfile

What is a devfile?

A [devfile](https://redhat-developer.github.io/devfile/) is a portable
file that describes your development environment. It allows for a
*portable* developmental environment without the need of
reconfiguration.

With a devfile you can describe:

  - The source code being used

  - Development components such as IDE tools (VSCode) and application
    runtimes (Yarn / NPM)

  - A list of pre-defined commands that can be ran

  - Projects to initially clone

Odo takes this devfile and transforms it into a workspace of multiple
containers running on OpenShift, Kubernetes or Docker.

Devfile’s are YAML files with a defined structure, take a look at the
general
[schema](https://github.com/redhat-developer/devfile/blob/master/docs/devfile.md)
of devfile.

# Odo and devfile

When deploying a devfile using odo, odo will automatically look at the
default [devfile](https://github.com/elsony/devfile-registry)
[registries](https://github.com/eclipse/che-devfile-registry/).
Interacting with the devfile registries allows a user to pull a standard
`devfile.yaml` and begin development immediately.

An example deployment scenario:

1.  `odo create` will look at devfile registry and pull down the
    `devfile.yaml` file

2.  odo push parses and then deploys the component in the following
    order:
    
    1.  Parses and validates the YAML file
    
    2.  Deploys the development environment to your OpenShift cluster
    
    3.  Synchronizes your source code to the containers
    
    4.  Executes any prerequisite commands

# Deploying your first devfile

**Prerequisites**

  - Before proceeding, you must know your ingress domain cluster name.
    For example: `apps-crc.testing` is the cluster domain name for [Red
    Hat CodeReady Containers](https://github.com/code-ready/crc)

  - Enable experimental mode for odo. This can be done by: `odo
    preference set experimental true`

# Creating a project

Create a project to keep your source code, tests, and libraries
organized in a separate single unit.

1.  Log in to a OpenShift cluster:
    
    ``` sh
      $ odo login -u developer -p developer
    ```

2.  Create a project:
    
    ``` sh
      $ odo project create myproject
       ✓  Project 'myproject' is ready for use
       ✓  New project created and now using project : myproject
    ```
    
    \== Listing all available devfile components
    
      - Before deploying your first component, have a look at what is
        available:
        
        ``` sh
          $ odo catalog list components
          Odo OpenShift Components:
          NAME              PROJECT       TAGS                        SUPPORTED

In our example, we will be using `java-spring-boot` to deploy a sample
[Springboot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) component.

# Deploying a Java Spring Boot® component to an OpenShift cluster

In this example we will be deploying an [example Springboot
component](https://github.com/odo-devfiles/springboot-ex) that uses
[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) and Java 8 JDK.

1.  Download the example Spring Boot® component
    
    ``` sh
     $ git clone https://github.com/odo-devfiles/springboot-ex
    ```

2.  Change the current directory to the component directory:
    
    ``` sh
     $ cd <directory-name>
    ```

3.  List the contents of the directory to see that the front end is a
    Java application:
    
    ``` sh
     $ ls
     chart  Dockerfile  Dockerfile-build  Dockerfile-tools  Jenkinsfile  pom.xml  README.md  src
    ```

4.  Create a component configuration of Spring Boot component-type named
    myspring:
    
    ``` sh
       $ odo create java-spring-boot myspring
       Experimental mode is enabled, use at your own risk
    
       Validation
        ✓  Checking devfile compatibility [71105ns]
        ✓  Validating devfile component [153481ns]
    
       Please use odo push command to create the component with source deployed
    ```

5.  Create a URL in order to access the deployed component:
    
    ``` sh
     $ odo url create --host apps-crc.testing
      ✓  URL myspring-8080.apps-crc.testing created for component: myspring
    
     To apply the URL configuration changes, please use odo push
    ```
    
    <div class="note">
    
    You must use your cluster host domain name when creating your URL.
    
    </div>

6.  Push the component to the cluster:
    
    ``` sh
       $ odo push
        •  Push devfile component myspring  ...
        ✓  Waiting for component to start [30s]
    
       Applying URL changes
        ✓  URL myspring-8080: http://myspring-8080.apps-crc.testing created
        ✓  Checking files for pushing [752719ns]
        ✓  Syncing files to the component [887ms]
        ✓  Executing devbuild command "/artifacts/bin/build-container-full.sh" [23s]
        ✓  Executing devrun command "/artifacts/bin/start-server.sh" [2s]
        ✓  Push devfile component myspring [57s]
        ✓  Changes successfully pushed to component
    ```

7.  List the URLs of the component:
    
    ``` sh
     $ odo url list
     Found the following URLs for component myspring
     NAME              URL                                       PORT     SECURE
     myspring-8080     http://myspring-8080.apps-crc.testing     8080     false
    ```

8.  View your deployed application using the generated URL:
    
    ``` sh
      $ curl http://myspring-8080.apps-crc.testing
    ```

# Deploying a Node.js® component to an OpenShift cluster

component](https://github.com/odo-devfiles/nodejs-ex) that uses
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

1.  Download the example Node.js® component
    
    ``` sh
     $ git clone https://github.com/odo-devfiles/nodejs-ex
    ```

2.  Change the current directory to the component directory:
    
    ``` sh
     $ cd <directory-name>
    ```

     $ ls
     app  LICENSE  package.json  package-lock.json  README.md
    ```

4.  Create a component configuration of Node.js component-type named
    mynodejs:
    
    ``` sh
     $ odo create nodejs mynodejs
     Experimental mode is enabled, use at your own risk
    
     Validation
     ✓  Checking devfile compatibility [106956ns]
     ✓  Validating devfile component [250318ns]
    
     Please use odo push command to create the component with source deployed
    ```

5.  Create a URL in order to access the deployed component:
    
    ``` sh
     $ odo url create --host apps-crc.testing
      ✓  URL mynodejs-8080.apps-crc.testing created for component: mynodejs
    
     To apply the URL configuration changes, please use odo push
    ```
    
    <div class="note">
    
    You must use your cluster host domain name when creating your URL.
    
    </div>

6.  Push the component to the cluster:
    
    ``` sh
     $ odo push
      •  Push devfile component mynodejs  ...
      ✓  Waiting for component to start [27s]
    
     Applying URL changes

         NAME              URL                                       PORT     SECURE
         mynodejs-8080     http://mynodejs-8080.apps-crc.testing     8080     false
    ```

8.  View your deployed application using the generated URL:
    
    ``` sh
       $ curl http://mynodejs-8080.apps-crc.testing
    ```

# Deploying a Java Spring Boot® component locally to Docker

In this example, we will be deploying the same Java Spring Boot®
component we did earlier, but to a locally running Docker instance.

**Prerequisites:** Docker `17.05` or higher installed

1.  Enabling the separate pushtarget preference:
    
    ``` sh
     $ odo preference set pushtarget docker
     Global preference was successfully updated
    ```
    
    You can configure a separate push target by making use of the
    `pushtarget` preference.

2.  Create a component configuration of Spring Boot component-type named
    mydockerspringboot:
    
    ``` sh
      $ odo create java-spring-boot mydockerspringboot
      Experimental mode is enabled, use at your own risk
    
      Validation
       ✓  Checking devfile compatibility [26759ns]
       ✓  Validating devfile component [75889ns]
    
      Please use odo push command to create the component with source deployed
    ```

3.  Create a URL in order to access the deployed component:
    
    ``` sh
     $ odo url create --port 8080
      ✓  URL local-mydockerspringboot-8080 created for component: mydockerspringboot with exposed port: 37833
    
     To apply the URL configuration changes, please use odo push
    ```
    
    In order to access the docker application, exposed ports are
    required and automatically generated by odo.

4.  Deploy the Spring Boot devfile component to Docker:
    
    ``` sh
      $ odo push
       •  Push devfile component mydockerspringboot  ...
       ✓  Pulling image maysunfaisal/springbootbuild [601ms]
    
      Applying URL configuration
       ✓  URL 127.0.0.1:37833 created
       ✓  Starting container for maysunfaisal/springbootbuild [550ms]
       ✓  Pulling image maysunfaisal/springbootruntime [581ms]
    
      Applying URL configuration
       ✓  URL 127.0.0.1:37833 created
       ✓  Starting container for maysunfaisal/springbootruntime [505ms]
       ✓  Push devfile component mydockerspringboot [2s]
       ✓  Changes successfully pushed to component
    ```
    
    When odo deploys a devfile component, it pulls the images for each
    `dockercontainer` in `devfile.yaml` and deploys them.
    
    Each docker container that is deployed is labeled with the name of
    the odo component.
    
    Docker volumes are created for the project source, and any other
    volumes defined in the devfile and mounted to the necessary
    containers.
