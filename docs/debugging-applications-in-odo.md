Interactive debugging in odo is a Technology Preview feature only.
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production
service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete.
Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features
provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to
test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology
Preview features, see

With `odo`, you can attach a debugger to remotely debug your
application. This feature is only supported for NodeJS and Java
components.

Components created with `odo` run in the debug mode by default. A
debugger agent runs on the component, on a specific port. To start
debugging your application, you must start port forwarding and attach
the local debugger bundled in your Integrated development environment
(IDE).

# Debugging an application

You can debug your application on in `odo` with the `odo debug` command.

1.  After an application is deployed, start the port forwarding for your
    component to debug the application:
    
        $ odo debug port-forward

2.  Attach the debugger bundled in your IDE to the component.
    Instructions vary depending on your IDE.

# Configuring debugging parameters

You can specify a remote port with `odo config` command and a local port
with the `odo debug` command.

  - To set a remote port on which the debugging agent should run, run:
    
        $ odo config set DebugPort 9292
    
    <div class="note">
    
    You must redeploy your component for this value to be reflected on
    the component.
    
    </div>

  - To set a local port to port forward, run:
    
        $ odo debug port-forward --local-port 9292
    
    <div class="note">
    
    The local port value does not persist. You must provide it every
    time you need to change the port.
    
    </div>
