OpenShift Do (`odo`) is a fast and easy-to-use CLI tool for creating
applications on OpenShift. `odo` allows developers to concentrate on
creating applications without the need to administrate an OpenShift
cluster itself. Creating deployment configurations, build
configurations, service routes and other OpenShift elements are all
automated by `odo`.

Existing tools such as `oc` are more operations-focused and require a
deep understanding of Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts. `odo` abstracts
away complex Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts allowing developers to
focus on what is most important to them: code.

# Key features

`odo` is designed to be simple and concise with the following key
features:

  - Simple syntax and design centered around concepts familiar to
    developers, such as projects, applications, and components.

  - Completely client based. No server is required within the OpenShift
    cluster for deployment.

  - Official support for Node.js and Java components.

  - Partial compatibility with languages and frameworks such as Ruby,
    Perl, PHP, and Python.

  - Detects changes to local code and deploys it to the cluster
    automatically, giving instant feedback to validate changes in real
    time.

  - Lists all the available components and services from the OpenShift
    cluster.

# Core concepts

  - Project  
    A project is your source code, tests, and libraries organized in a
    separate single unit.

  - Application  
    An application is a program designed for end users. An application
    consists of multiple microservices or components that work
    individually to build the entire application. Examples of
    applications: a video game, a media player, a web browser.

  - Component  
    A component is a set of Kubernetes resources which host code or
    data. Each component can be run and deployed separately. Examples of
    components: Node.js, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby.

  - Service  
    A service is software that your component links to or depends on.
    Examples of services: MariaDB, Jenkins, MySQL. In `odo`, services
    are provisioned from the OpenShift Service Catalog and must be
    enabled within your cluster.

Supported languages, container images, and package managers

### Listing available container images

<div class="note">

The list of available container images is sourced from the clusterâ€™s
internal container registry and external registries associated with the
cluster.

</div>

To list the available components and associated container images for
your cluster:

1.  Log in to the OpenShift cluster with `odo`:
    
        $ odo login -u developer -p developer

2.  List the available `odo` supported and unsupported components and
    corresponding container images:
    
        $ odo catalog list components
        Odo Supported OpenShift Components:
        NAME        PROJECT      TAGS
        java       openshift     8,latest
        nodejs     openshift     10,8,8-RHOAR,latest
        
        Odo Unsupported OpenShift Components:
        NAME                      PROJECT       TAGS
        dotnet                    openshift     1.0,1.1,2.1,2.2,latest
        fuse7-eap-openshift       openshift     1.3
    
    The `TAGS` column represents the available image versions, for
    example, `10` represents the `rhoar-nodejs/nodejs-10` container
    image.
